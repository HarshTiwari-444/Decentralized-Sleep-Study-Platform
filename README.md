# Decentralized Sleep Study Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Sleep Study Platform is a blockchain-based application that incentivizes users to contribute their sleep data for scientific research while maintaining privacy and data ownership. Users earn tokens for submitting valid sleep data, creating a decentralized network of sleep research contributors.

The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure transparent reward distribution, immutable data storage, and trustless interaction between researchers and participants. By gamifying sleep data collection, we aim to build the world's largest decentralized sleep research database.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize sleep research by creating a global, decentralized platform where:

- **Individuals own their data** and are fairly compensated for contributions
- **Researchers access high-quality, diverse sleep data** without intermediaries
- **Sleep health awareness** is promoted through community engagement
- **Scientific breakthroughs** in sleep medicine are accelerated through crowd-sourced data
- **Privacy is preserved** while enabling meaningful research insights

We envision a future where sleep research is democratized, accessible, and beneficial to both individuals and the global scientific community.
